# Airport Calendar App

Wee single page web app to create a ics calendar file for a flight itinerary. Handy tool for my own use as not every airline provides a calendar file for their flights.

## Tech Stack? I guess. 

- Vite
- React
- TypeScript
- MUI
- dayjs
- GitHub Pages

## TODO

Don't think I will be adding any more features to this. But won't hurt to write a wishlist. Let me know if you want anything added. 

- [ ] Suuport output for Google Calendar and Outlook
- [ ] Prevent user time travel
